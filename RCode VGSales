This analysis employs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) methods, including:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
Is an approach to analyzing datasets with the aim of summarizing their main characteristics using visual methods. This technique includes data visualization using graphs such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots to understand data distribution, relationships between variables, and trends over time. Statistical analysis is also applied to measure correlations between variables, convey the significance of findings, and test hypotheses to understand the data more deeply before it is formally modeled [1].  

- **The Kruskal-Wallis**:  
Is used as a non-parametric alternative to the ANOVA test, useful for comparing the medians of three or more independent groups of data. In the context of video game sales analysis, this test is used to see whether there are significant differences in sales between regions or certain game genres [2].  
 
- **The Chi-Square test**:  
Is a statistical technique for testing the relationship between two categorical variables. In video game sales analysis, this test is used to determine whether there is a relationship between game genre preferences and market region, or whether there is a dependency between the popularity of a particular platform and game sales by genre [3].

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px;"></div>
#### **B. Handling Missing Data**  

```{r}
data <- dataVG[!is.na(dataVG$Year) & dataVG$Year != "N/A", ]
```
**Reason**: Removing rows where the Year column is NaN or "N/A" ensures that only complete and valid data are used. Missing data can introduce bias and reduce the reliability of models. By removing them, we ensure that the analysis is based on accurate information.  

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px;"></div>
#### **C. Filtering Records based on Specific Years**    
```{r}
data <- data[data$Year %in% c("2008", "2009", "2007", "2010", "2006"), ]
```

**Reason**: Selecting only rows with specific years (2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010) focuses the analysis on a relevant time period or recent data that is more important for the current analysis. This reduces noise and increases the relevance of analysis results by discarding potentially irrelevant data.  

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px;"></div>
#### **D. Changing Year Column to a Factor**  
```{r}
data$Year <- factor(data$Year)
```
**Reason**: Changing the Year column to a factor is necessary because years are typically used as categorical variables in statistical analysis and visualization. By converting it to a factor, we can easily perform grouping operations, create contingency tables, and make relevant plots such as histograms or bar charts to understand the distribution of data across years.  
<div style="margin-bottom: 15px;"></div>
By following these preprocessing steps, the data becomes cleaner, more focused, and ready for further analysis. Good preprocessing helps minimize potential errors or biases in interpreting analysis results and enhances the ability to derive meaningful insights from the available data.  
 
<div style="margin-bottom: 20px;"></div></div>

### **4.	Data Exploration**

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
#### **A. Boxplots of Sales Data**  
```{r echo=FALSE}
# Reshape the data
df_long <- dataVG %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(NA_Sales, EU_Sales, JP_Sales, Other_Sales, Global_Sales),
               names_to = "Sales_Type", values_to = "Sales")

# Plotting the combined boxplots using facets
ggplot(df_long, aes(x = "", y = Sales)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~ Sales_Type, scales = "free_y", labeller = as_labeller(c(
    NA_Sales = "NA Sales",
    EU_Sales = "EU Sales",
    JP_Sales = "JP Sales",
    Other_Sales = "Other Sales",
    Global_Sales = "Global Sales"
  ))) +
  ggtitle("Boxplots of Sales Data") +
  xlab("") + ylab("Sales")
```

<div style="text-align: justify;">
**Key Observations**  

- **Outliers Across Regions**:     
The visualization shows a single outlier in each region.
- **Median Distribution**:     
All region’s median score is almost similar showing a near-zero score.
- **Regional Variances**:   
While Action remains dominant, the gap between Action and other genres varies by region. It's notably larger in North America and Europe compared to Japan.
- **Interpretation**:    
The visualization shows that the sales of video games everywhere in the world is rather flat and distributed by the same manner.  

**Insights**  

- **Sales Strategy**: 
The variability and presence of outliers in every region indicate a need for a more tailored sales strategy. Identifying why certain games perform exceptionally well or poorly can help in developing better marketing and development plans.  
- **Global Strategy**:
Recognizing the game preference for everyone could be a strategy to release games in the future.  
<div style="margin-bottom: 20px;"></div>

```{r, include=FALSE}
# select numeric columns to see correlation
correlation_matrix <- cor(dataVG[7:11])
print(correlation_matrix)
```

#### **B. Correlation Matrix**  
```{r echo=FALSE, message1=FALSE}
corrplot(correlation_matrix, method="color", type="upper", order="hclust")
```
<div style="text-align: justify;">
**Key Observations**  

- **Contribution from each region towards global sales**:     
The visualization interprets the different sales across regions make up the global sales. Japan shows the least contribution and North America shows the most contribution.
- **Population influence**:     
North America sales implies that the more the population size is, the more will they contribute to global sales of video games. Larger populations mean more individuals are likely to purchase video games, spanning a diverse range of age groups and demographics. Additionally, higher population densities in urban areas facilitate better marketing reach and distribution efficiencies.  
- **Interpretation**:    
Trends play a major role in sales, as seen in the visualization. The success of sales in Europe, Japan, and North America defines the video game trend in these three regions. In contrast, other regions, despite having larger populations, cannot compete with the video game sales of these regions.    

**Insights**  

- **High-Priority Markets**: 
Given the importance of Europe, Japan, and North America, game developers and marketers should prioritize these regions for product launches, marketing campaigns, and tailored content.    
- **Localized Content**:
Since these regions define trends, creating localized content that caters to the specific preferences of gamers in Europe, Japan, and North America can boost sales and engagement.    
<div style="margin-bottom: 20px;"></div>


#### **C. Top 5 Years with Highest Global Sales**  
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
total_sales <- aggregate(Global_Sales ~ Year, data = dataVG, sum)

# Get top 5 years with highest global sales
top5_years <- head(total_sales[order(-total_sales$Global_Sales), ], 5)

# Convert year to factor
top5_years$Year <- factor(top5_years$Year, levels = seq(min(top5_years$Year), max(top5_years$Year)))

ggplot(top5_years, aes(x = Year, y = Global_Sales, group = 1)) +
  geom_line(color = "darkred", size = 1) +
  geom_point(color = "black", size = 3) +
  labs(title = "Top 5 Years with Highest Global Sales", x = "Year", y = "Global Sales (in millions)") +
  theme(plot.background = element_rect(color = "black", size = 1)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = Global_Sales), vjust = -1, color = "black", size = 3)

```
<div style="text-align: justify;">
**Key Observations**  

- **Sales peaks and troughs**:     
The visualization indicates that 2008 represents the highest peak of sales, while 2006 marks the lowest trough.  
- **Irregular patterns**:     
The visualization reveals inconsistent sales trends before and after 2008. Specifically, there is a significant leap in sales from 2006 to 2007, with a notable increase of 100 million units. In contrast, after 2008, all sales go down slowly.    
- **Interpretation**:    
The upward trend in the line graph suggests a growth trajectory for global sales over the past five years. The year with the possible decline might be an outlier or indicate a temporary setback.      

**Insights**  

- It is possible that the company is expanding into new markets, or that its products are becoming more popular. The increase in sales could also be due to a general improvement in the global economy.

### **5.	Statistical Analysis**
<div style="margin-bottom: 20px;">

#### **A. Chi Square**    

<div style="text-align: justify;">
**Definition**  
The Chi-Square test is a statistical procedure for determining the difference between observed and expected data. This test can also be used to determine whether it correlates to the categorical variables in our data. It helps to find out whether a difference between two categorical variables is due to chance or a relationship between them [4].  

A chi-square test is a statistical test that is used to compare observed and expected results. The goal of this test is to identify whether a disparity between actual and predicted data is due to chance or to a link between the variables under consideration. As a result, the chi-square test is an ideal choice for aiding in our understanding and interpretation of the connection between our two categorical variables.  
  
**Why do we use Chi Square Test? **  
There are a few advantages in using the Chi Square Test. Advantages of the Chi-square include its robustness with respect to distribution of the data, its ease of computation, the detailed information that can be derived from the test, its use in studies for which parametric assumptions cannot be met, and its flexibility in handling data from both two group and multiple group studies.    

**Chi Square Test Formula**  

$$ \chi^2 = \sum \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i} $$  

**Where:**  

* χ² (chi-square) = statistic test value
* i = subscript denoting individual cells in the contingency table
* O_i = observed value in cell i
* E_i = expected value in cell i  
    
The degrees of freedom in a statistical calculation represent the number of variables that can vary in a calculation. The degrees of freedom can be calculated to ensure that chi-square tests are statistically valid. These tests are frequently used to compare observed data with data that would be expected to be obtained if a particular hypothesis were true [5].

<div style="text-align: justify;">
**Chi Square Result**:    
The chi-square test results in the image show that there is no statistically significant correlation between the year, genre, platform, and publisher distributions of games. 

- **Test** : This column shows the chi-square statistic which is a measure of how much the observed data deviates from what would be expected under the null hypothesis (i.e., there is no relationship between the variables).  
Chi Square Statistic - These values represent the chi-square statistic for each test (Year, Genre, Platform, Publisher).
- **PValue** : This column shows the p-value, which is the probability of observing a chi-square statistic this extreme or more extreme, assuming the null hypothesis is true. A low p-value (typically below 0.05) indicates that the observed data is unlikely to have occurred by chance, and thus we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a relationship between the variables.

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px;"></div>  
#### **B. Kruskal Wallis**      

<div style="text-align: justify;">
**Definition**  
The Kruskal–Wallis test is a statistical test used to compare two or more groups for a continuous or discrete variable. It is a non-parametric test, meaning that it assumes no particular distribution of your data and is analogous to the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) [6].  
  
**Why do we use Kruskal-Wallis Test?**    
The Kruskal Wallis test and other non-parametric (or distribution-free) tests are useful to test hypotheses when the assumption for normality of the data does not hold. They make no assumptions about the shape of data distributions, and this makes them particularly useful when a dataset is small. Our dataset is suitable for this method as our gathered data is considered relatively small. 

**Kruskal-Wallis Test Formula**    
Let's say the null hypothesis is true and thus there is no difference between the independent samples. Then high and low ranks are randomly distributed across the samples and should be equally distributed across the groups. Therefore, the probability that a rank is assigned to a group is the same for all groups [7].    

If there is no difference between the groups, the mean value of the ranks should also be the same in all groups. The expected value of the ranks for each group is then given by     

$$E_R = \frac{n+1}{2}$$  
Each sample has the same expected value of the ranks, which corresponds to the expected value of the population. Furthermore, the variance of the ranks is needed, the variance can be calculated with the following formula:      

$$\sigma^2 = \frac{n^2 - 1}{12}$$  

In the Kruskal-Wallis test, the test variable H is calculated. The H value corresponds to the X^2^ value. The H value results from:    

$$H = \frac{n - 1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^k \frac{(R_i - \bar{E_R})^2}{\sigma^2}$$

### **7. Conclusion**
<div style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
- The results of sales changes and popular regions in the gaming industry from 2006 to 2010 are useful in the development of a strategy. Yearly sales vary with different years having different amounts of sales influenced by new console-launches and economic conditions as depicted by the extremely high sales recorded in 2008.  
- Overall, the action genre was the most popular, although the proportion of the genre in different countries varied; for example, a larger proportion of role-playing games were from Japan.   
- The largest results were demonstrated by the North American region, followed by the European region, and other regions such as Japan and the rest of the world combined were less.   
- Nintendo was the number one star in sales with strong franchises and the most games and top titles namely Wii Sports, Mario Kart Wii, Wii Sports Resort, and others, also in hardware as well with Nintendo DS and Wii.   
- Overall, this analysis underlines the importance of understanding regional preferences, focusing on major markets, and leveraging strong brands to enhance sales in thefuture.
