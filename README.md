## E. Methods and Analytical Techniques  

his analysis employs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) methods, including:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Is an approach to analyzing datasets with the aim of summarizing their main characteristics using visual methods. This technique includes data visualization using graphs such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots to understand data distribution, relationships between variables, and trends over time. Statistical analysis is also applied to measure correlations between variables, convey the significance of findings, and test hypotheses to understand the data more deeply before it is formally modeled.

- The Kruskal-Wallis:
Is used as a non-parametric alternative to the ANOVA test, useful for comparing the medians of three or more independent groups of data. In the context of video game sales analysis, this test is used to see whether there are significant differences in sales between regions or certain game genres.

- The Chi-Square test:
Is a statistical technique for testing the relationship between two categorical variables. In video game sales analysis, this test is used to determine whether there is a relationship between game genre preferences and market region, or whether there is a dependency between the popularity of a particular platform and game sales by genre.
